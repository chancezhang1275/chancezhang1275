# Repo Planning

The very basic idea of conducting all my projects is quite simple. 

>  First, struggle to get myself from the state of unknown unknown to the known unknown;
>  Then, with effective planning, tackle those known unknowns to reach known known. 

Therefore, after constructing the whole [EE-CS architecture](), one day I wrote my interests as follows

* [Repo Planning](#repo-planning)

* [module00 basic coding skills :hammer:,](#module00-basic-coding-skills-:hammer:,)

* [module01 images, videos, and graphics :camera:,](#module01-images,-videos,-and-graphics-:camera:,)

* [module02 computing systems :computer:,](#module02-computing-systems-:computer:,)

* [module03 intelligent systems :robot:,](#module03-intelligent-systems-:robot:,)

* [module04 business analysis ðŸ’¸,](#module04-business-analysis-ðŸ’¸,)

* [module05 collaborative projects :handshake:.](#module05-collaborative-projects-:handshake:.)

These make up my future repository structure. For each module, I will develop corresponding projects, naming them in a form like `module0X-XXXXX`. The following are the details of each module.  



# module00 basic coding skills :hammer:,

For this module, its main purpose is to get the essential skills to code. 

A general to-do-list can be written as 

- [ ] Know a bit of software engineering and product management;
- [ ] Get oneself a proper development environment; 
- [ ] Try to get some basic tools and combine them into a tool chain for one's development;
- [ ] Practise some languages, namely, C/ CPP and Python; 
- [ ] Learn the data structures and algorithms using LeetCode; 
- [ ] Learn to use some system software. 

>A full list from my point of view can be found on this [page](). This module will most possibly be my notes. 



# module01 images, videos, and graphics :camera:,

This module mainly contains sensing, processing and display, three parts. List them as 

- [ ] Sensing | Camera, ISP Pipeline;
- [ ] Processing | DSP, DIP, DL -> CPU, NPU, FPGA;
- [ ] Display | Qt, CG -> CPU, GPU.



# module02 computing systems :computer:,

Based on the traditional classification methods, here we have

- [ ] Computer Architecture | _PU, Storage, SoC, ...
- [ ] System Software | OS, Compiler, ...
- [ ] Coding on CPU | One step further from module00 ...
- [ ] HPC | OpenCL (FPGA), Parallel Programming (Multi-core CPU), CUDA/ Vulkan/ OpenGLES (GPU), Distributed System, ...
- [ ] AI System | AI Hardware, AI Compiler, AI Framework, AutoML/ AutoDL, ...



I am currently working on constructing a tiny CNN framework (toy level), which could be found on my GitHub repository soon or later. 



# module03 intelligent systems :robot:,

This module focuses more on high-level signal processing, including

- [ ] Rule-based Signal Processing | Analysis, Fourier, Statistics, ...
- [ ] Data-based Learning | Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, ...
- [ ] Control & Robotics | Linear System, Non-linear System, System Behaviours, ...



# module04 business analysis ðŸ’¸,

Business analysis is more of social science than natural science, including

- [ ] Management | Product Management, Project Management, Business Management, ...

- [ ] Data Analysis | Data Visualisation, Data Mining, Recommendation Systems, ...

- [ ] Finance | Finance Analysis, ...



# module05 collaborative projects :handshake:.

From my side, all the collaborative projects are of this module, which may vary in the contents. 

The very recent one is the [autoCar-a_safe_drive](https://github.com/chancezhang1275/autoCar-a_safe_drive).
